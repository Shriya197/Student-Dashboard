# Student-Dashboard
This is a  simple responsive student dashboard designed using HTML ,CSS and a little touch of javascript.
This dashboard contains a sidebar menu and a container which contains activities,tasks and all other informations related to students.
To create piechart i have used the google chart.
To add icons on menubar i have used line awesome icons(https://icons8.com/line-awesome).
Other elements in this dashboard are created with the help of html and css only.
